Flexbox is a new module in CSS3 that makes it easy to align elements to one another, in different directions and orders.

The main idea behind flexbox is to given the container the abilith to expand and to shrink elements to best use all the available space.

Flexbox replaces float layouts, using less and more readable and logigal code.

Flexbox completely changes the way that we build one-dimensional layouts.


***************** USE FLEXBOX ***********************************

The element on which we use flexbox is called the flex container.
And all we have to do in order to create a Flex container is to set its display to flex.
	
	display: flex;

We can also set it to flex-inline which will then create a Flex container that behaves like an in-line element

	display: inline-flex;


All the direct children of the Flex container are called the Flex items.

Now, the direction which these flex items are layout is called the main axis, in X direction. The other perpenidicular axis is simply called the cross axis, in Y direction. 
It's important to be aware of these names because we can change the direction of the main axis.
And also because there are different ways of aligning elements both along the main axis and the cross axis.

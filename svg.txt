In order to select svg

iconMoonApp -> choose a library -> Generate SVG & More -> icon(granazi) -> if you don't want a png uncheck png -> download -> In folder only need is the SVG file and symbol-defs.svg

symbol-defs.svg:  is a spite file, a sprite file is a file which contains all svg we choose before in one file.

Also we have the demo.html file


IN HTML 
use svg tag and inside use the use tag 
with xlink:href attribute
with xlink:href='
(first the path folder all the way in sprite.svg)
(second the # symbol)
(third the name of the svg)'

// example
 <svg class="your_className">
   <use xlink:href='./img/sprite.svg#icon-magnifying-glass></use>
 </svg>


the xlink:href works only in a web server (include live-server)



// If you want to change svg color select the fill propery

.className_svg_has{
   fill: red;
}
